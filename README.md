# SmartWF: Learning-Based Secure Wind Farm Control

This project is part of the TI3165TU Capstone Applied AI Project course as part of the Engineering with AI minor offered at TU Delft. The repository is split up into 3 parts, each contaning different models with different specifications and

## Models
This repository contains 3 different styles of models, the ```Must```, ```Should``` and ```Could``` model. These models increase in complexity and capabilities 

### Must
The ```Must``` model is the most simple, it aims to make basic predictions on the Damage Equivalent Load (DEL) of a wind turbine based on the wind velocity and the standard deviation of the wind

### Should
The ```Should``` has increased predictive capabilities, being able to predict a time series of the blade root bending moment 

### Could

## Dataset

## Installation

The GitHub repo can easily be cloned to your local envoirnment for use of the functions or any of the trained models

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/NielsDeln/SmartWF-Capstone
```
